# Beecara-Web

This project, Beecara-Web, was developed during a hackathon competition. It's a web application that provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to navigate through various components.

The application includes features such as user authentication, a carousel for displaying a collection of items, and card elements for presenting information in a visually appealing manner. Each card includes a title, description, and a button for navigating to more detailed information about the item.

The project utilizes Bootstrap for creating a responsive and mobile-first website, and Icomoon font for icons. The styles are written in SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, making the CSS more efficient and easier to maintain.

Please refer to the individual sections below for more detailed information about the setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
